# What do you mean by Ann?
 An artificial neural network (ANN) is the component of artificial intelligence that is meant to simulate the functioning of a human brain. Processing units make up ANNs, which in turn consist of inputs and outputs.

# Parts of ANN:-
   # 1. The Neuron
    It is the centerpiece of the Neural Network. For point of comparison, there will be some examination of the human brain; how that works and why we want to replicate it.   
    
# 2. The Activation Function
    This is the process applied to data within the neuron. We will be exploring which are most commonly used and understanding which is most appropriate for your Neural Network.

# 3. Practical Application
    Then we get into some deep learning on the machinations of the Neural Network. We will follow one in action to see what we are striving towards. But instead of the T2 slicing open his flesh to reveal the robot skeleton beneath, weâ€™ll be looking at how a Neural Network can predict housing prices. Not as dramatic but potentially just as upsetting.

### Types of Activation Function 
    * The Threshold Function
    * The Sigmoid Function
    * The Rectifier Function
    * Hyperbolic Tangent Function



### Steps of ANN:-
    1. Data preprocessing
    2. Creating the neuron layers
    3. Training the Model using Train data
    4. Testing the model using the Test data
    5. Pridicting the single value
    

### Brief Explanation
    These is a model which is based on ANN and Tensorflow.The given dataset explain us about the past 6 months coustmers data,These dataset tells us that,How         many coustemers are leaving the bank and what are there data. The "Task" is to find the reason behind the coustmers leaving 
    If we get the know the reason at that time the bank can offer special offers to the coustmers who is edge of leaving the bank by closing his/her account.
    To find the reason we will use the ANN for Classification model and predict the answer.
